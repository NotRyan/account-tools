# account-tools

Automatically creates empty Berkeley email lists and stores the addresses in an sql database. 
For reference, berkeley email lists are addresses at .lists.berkeley.edu which can be mailed to, and will by default redirect all emails sent to them to the list participants. By default, this will only be the email you use to sign in. This makes it useful for creating a large amount of easily accessibly, unique .edu emails.

Currently broken because of the new two factor authentication calnet requires.
